### Developed by ###

### How do I run the application? ###

Simply go to the root of the project and run:

```
java -jar jar/iart_project1.jar
```

### Choosing a file ###

- In order to test the application a **file** must be chosen;<br>
- The file must follow the same rules as the ones provided in the root directory;<br> 
- The application will open a file explorer, and a file must be chosen;<br>
- There are six example files with different values located in the root of the project that can be used to test the application.

### Selecting an algorithm ###

- After choosing a file, a menu will be shown; <br> 
- After selecting one of the options, the application might ask for several parameters depending on the chosen algorithm;<br>
- When the algorithm finishes, a file name will be requested in order to save the results (the libraries and their books);<br>
- The file will then be saved as a **.txt** file in the root of the project.

### Additional Notes ###

- The same file can be used to run all the different algorithms with different parameters as many times as needed;<br>
- The application must be restarted in order to run the algorithms using another file.
